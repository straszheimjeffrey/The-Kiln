  "Builds a clay object. The arguments are alternating key-values, like this:

 (clay :glaze [glaze-one glaze-two]
       :args [item]
       :value (get-from-database item))

The allowed parameters are:

:id - The underlying id to use, must be unique, optional

:name - A symbol for debugging use, defaults to :id

:value - the code to run to produce the value. Within this code, any
form such as (?? a-clay optional-args...) will be converted to a
command to fire that clay in the current kiln.

:kiln - a symbol, if present, the calling kiln can be accessed using
this symbol.

:glaze - a vector of glazes (see below)

:args - a vec of symbols, the arguments that can be passed to this
clay. The args are visible within the :value, the :cleanups, and
the :glaze list.

:cleanup, :cleanup-success, :cleanup-failure - code to run at cleanup
time. :cleanup always runs, followed by either :cleanup-success
or :cleanup-failure, depending on which cleanup method is used. Each
cleanup routing is passed an additional argument ?self, which is the
original value computed for this clay. Also, the (?? clay ...) syntax
works here.

:extra - a map of extra data with user specified meaning

The glazes can be in two formats, a bare glaze (usually as a
symbol). For glazes that require arguments, provide a list with the
glaze first and the arguments following, like this:

 (clay :args [an-arg another-arg]
       :glaze [(some-glaze-with-args an-arg (?? some-clay))
               a-normal-glaze])
